Usually, people analyze the topic from the number of crime counts’ perspective. However, this time we will work from the number of arrest’s perspective. From this different point of view, we can applied various techniques of exploratory analysis and visualizations to uncover the underlying insights and trends of New York City’s crime environment. Specifically, we want to explore the characteristics of New York City’s crime among different boroughs, different age groups, different races. Additionally, we want to investigate how the crime characteristics change overtime. Lastly, we want to analyze whether Covid-19 pandemic has any impact on NYC’s crime pattern. In the following sections, we will clean, preprocess, and analyze the data through visualizations as well as interactive graphs. The datasets are provided by NYPD and extracted from NYC Open Data. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources The data is a list of every arrest in NYC from 2006 to now. This data is manually extracted every quarter and reviewed by the Office of Management Analysis and Planning before being posted on the NYPD website. The website for the data from 2006-2020 is: https:// data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Arrests-Data-Historic-/8h9b-rp9u, and the website for the data from Jan, 2021 to the end of September, 2021 is: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Arrest-Data-Year-to-Date-/uip8-fykc. The data includes information about 1 ARREST_KEY (numeric): Randomly generated persistent ID for each arrest 2 ARREST_DATE (character): Exact date of arrest for the reported event 3 PD_CD (numeric): Three digit internal classification code 4 PD_DESC (character): Description of internal classification corresponding with PD code 5 KY_CD (numeric): Three digit internal classification code 6 OFNS_DESC (character): Description of internal classification corresponding with KY code 7 LAW_CODE (character): Law code charges corresponding to the NYS Penal Law, VTL and other various local laws 8 LAW_CAT_CD (character): Level of offense: felony, misdemeanor, violation 9 ARREST_BORO (character): Borough of arrest.

The last column of the second dataset has the same content, but the different name with the last column of the first dataset. So First we rename the last column of the second dataset and then combine the two datasets. The “ARREST_DATE” column is in “char” format and we convert it into “Date” format. Since there are too much data in the dataset, we just focus on the data in the recent 10 years. So We just remain the records whose “ARREST_DATE” is larger than “01/01/2012”. Additionally, we convert the column of “OFNS_DESC”, “ARREST_BORO”, “AGE_GROUP”, “PERP_SEX”, “PERP_RACE” into categorical variables for future analysis. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values From the plot, we can see that compared with the whole data set there are very few NA values. After calculation, we find there are only 0.7% rows which contain NA values. Therefore, we decide to drop all the rows with NA values.

First of all, let’s use a bar plot to visualize the general distribution of arrest category. Since there are a lot of arrest types, I would only show the top 15 counts of the arrest types. In this way, we are able to visualize what kind of crimes are happening and being arrested in NYC. From the plot, we can observe that the highest number of arrests made by NYPD is to the type of “Dangerous Drugs”, having 466735 cases, significantly higher than the counts of rest of types. Indeed, NYC always has a bad reputation with dangerous drugs. The second highest count is the type of “Assault 3 &amp; Related OFFENSES”, which suggests the relative safety problem faced by NYC residents every day. We need to have tighter laws and control towards drugs as this is the most serious and frequent arrest categories. Next, let’s investigate the distribution of arrests count throughout NYC’s 5 boroughs. 5.1.1.2 What is the distribution of arrest rate in each NYC boroughs? In the above bar plot, we calculated the average arrest rate of NYC residents across the ten year interval, from 2012-2021. The plot, suggests that for each year, residents in Manhattan will be arrested for an average of 0.046 times, the highest rate across the five boroughs. Bronx is the second highest with a rate of 0.045. Both rates are significantly higher than the rate of the rest of 3 boroughs. Netx, let’s check the 5.1.1.3 What kind of crimes do different age groups tend to commit? First of all, for residents whose age are older than 65, they barely commit any crimes or being arrested by NYPD. As expected, the arrests made by NYPD are heavily concentrated on the age group of 25-44. The second highest age group is 18-24. It indicates that most crimes committed and offenders arrested are in a relatively young age. For the distribution of offenders’ age group younger than 65 vs arrest categories, we find that for age group from 18-64, “dangerous drugs” has the highest number of arrests made, which is consistent with the overall arrest categories distribution. For teenager who is under 18, however, “robbery”, “assault” and “dangerous drugs” all have similar numbers of arrests, with robbery being the slightly highest. Unlike for other age groups, robbery stands out to be the most frequent one. This is alarming. We need to build better programs and have better education to get more teenagers off the streets and back to school. For the distribution of offenders’ race vs arrest categories, first we found that there are barely any arrests made to “American Indian / Alaskan Native”, presumably because of the low populations of the group living in New York City. For the rest of the races, we can observe that, except for “Asian / Pacific Islander”, all the offenders in the other races were being arrested due to “dangerous drugs” most frequently. For “Asian / Pacific Islander” residents, the highest arrest category is “Assault 3 &amp; Related Offenses”. Additionally, there is an alarming trend: The number of arrests made to black NYC residents is significantly higher than that of any other races. Is there a systematic discrimination against black people in the arrests made by NYPD? In the When section, we will use time series data to find out. However, better education and benefits program are necessary to solve this situation. For the distribution of offenders’ sex vs arrest categories, intuitively the number of male offenders are significantly higher than the number of female offenders. Interetsingily, for female offenders, the highest arrests made are to the category of “Assault 3 &amp; Related Offenses”, with “Petit Larceny” and “Dangerous Drugs” being closer for the second and third. On the other hand, male offenders in NYC are usually arrested for “Dangerous Drugs”, which is consistent with the overall distribution. In the next section, let’s use some maps to explore and visualize the locations as well as each arrests being made. 5.1.2 Where: We will use New Yorkc City’s map to visualize the type and location of the arrests occurred. For normal citizens, they are more concerned about crimes of theft, assault, weapons as well as robbery. Thus, we will create a map to visualize the frequencies of occurrences of these types of arrests. For crimes regarding theft, from the map, we can observe that they are heavily concentrated in Manhattan’s mid town and downtown. Most New York City’s business centers and financial centers are located there, which explains the high case counts of theft. After all, mid town and downtown locate NYC’s central business district. From the map of weapon related arrests, we can observe that they are mostly concentrated in Harlem of Manhattan, Bronx and Brooklyn. These three neighborhoods also have heavy gang activities, which corresponds to the heavy weapon related crimes. Regular residents should avoid traveling through these locations alone, especially on foot, as the regions are flooded with guns. For the map of assaults &amp; murder related arrests, we can observe that they are mostly made in the population-heavy areas. However, Upper Manhattan and Bronx have the worst problem of assault &amp; murders, which is consistent with the map of weapon related arrests. For the map of robbery related arrests, similarly, cases are heavily concentrated in Harlem, Bronx. Also, downtown and mid town Manhattan have high cases counts as well. Due to the higher concentration of middle class and upper class people in mid town and downtown Manhattan, it has become a location of robbery as well. 5.1.2.1 Columbia University As Columbia Lions, we are also curious about the arrests being made around the campus, especially for Where are the most frequent places and how should we avoid the areas? Let’s find out in the following maps. From the two maps, we can observe that the further from the campus, the more arrests are being made. For instance, as we get closer to Harlem, arrests of Assault, Murder and Robbery are increasing. Therefore, we would want to stay close to the campus, when we travel alone. 5.1.3 When: In this section, we would like to investigate the development of the trend of arrests categories throughout 2012-2021. How is the overall arrests distribution developed over time? How has the types of arrests being made changed over time? We will use ridge plots and line plots to find out. Due to the high number of the arrest categories, we will first focus on the top 15 arrest categories. The ridge plot indicates that, for each type of the top 15 Arrest types, the overall distribution is moving toward a downward trend. The number of arrests made to the major arrest categories are all decreasing toward the end of 2021. For instance, there is a sharp decrease since 2018 for “Dangerous Drugs” and a sharp decline for “Petit Larceny” since 2016. It could suggests that the overall safety in NYC is getting better. Less and less offenders are being arrested by NYPD throughout 2012-2021. Similarly, let’s see how the trend of crimes in each boroughs change throughout the years, using a line plot. The above plot also shows that for each of the borough, the crime counts are decreasing from 2012-2021. Even though in 2014 and 2016 there are a little spikes in crime counts, the overall trends are in decline, especially for recent years. This finding also corresponds to our previous findings that the overall arrest counts in NYC is in a downward trend. additionally, we can observe that, except for Staten Island, the gaps of arrests counts between the other four boroughs are closing and the arrests count of the four boroughs are all converging toward a lower number at the end of 2021. 5.1.3.1 Arrests Trend for Teenage Perpetrator As mentioned in the previous section, the distribution of arrests made to teenagers are different to the other age groups. Here, we would want to visualize the trend of teenage crimes, how has the crime categories changed throughout the years? As we can observe from the ridge plot, the overall trend is promising as the number of arrests made to teen offenders is declining. A lot of teenagers were arrested for the possession of stolen property from 2012 - 2014, and the number suddenly drops. Also, for the highest counts arrest categories of teenagers, “Dangerous Drugs”, “Robbery” and “Assault 3 &amp; Related Offense”, they are all decreasing from 2012-201. However, we can observe that there are some increasing trends in certain arrest categories. For instance, ’Murder &amp; Non-NEGL. Manslaughter”, “Unauthorized use of a Vehicle” and “Criminal Mischief &amp; Related OF” are all spiking in 2020 and 2021. Even though the overall number of crimes committed by teenagers are decreasing, we should be alert of the increase in certain categories. Next, we will use a summary table to describe the effect of Covid pandemic to the arrests made in New York City. 5.1.3.2 What’s the effect of Covid to the general arrest / crime trend in NYC? Let’s use a table to indicate the summarized difference Table 5.1: Arrests Categories that experienced Decrease after Covid Arrest_Category Arrest_Count_Before_Covid Arrest_Count_After_Covid Percentage_Change OFFENSES INVOLVING FRAUD 1070 2051 91.682% BURGLARY 4647 5997 29.051% MURDER &amp; NON-NEGL.

As expected from the previous explorations, there is a decrease in the arrests made to the most types of crimes post Covid. This is likely due to the government’s relief packages as well as the lockdown measures. However, there are four crime types that experienced increase since the Covid pandemic. For “Offense Involving Fraud”, the number of arrests made increases from 1070 to 2015, a total increase of 92%. After Covid, people may prefer conduct businesses through online platforms, which gives offenders more opportunities to commit fraud. The arrests count of “Burglary”, and “Murder &amp; Non-Negl Manslaughter” also increases significantly, 29% and 16% respectively. Covid pandemic is taking a tow to many people, and for some, they sought to extreme measures toward their problems.

Also, the arrests made by NYPD are heavily concentrated on the age group of 25-44. For the location of the crimes and arrests, we have found that they are mostly concentrated in Harlem, Brooklyn, Bronx, as well as downtown Manhattan. Around the campus of Columbia University, there are not many arrests being made, and the closer we get to campus, the safer we are. Lastly, we found that the overall arrest counts in New York City is decreasing, which suggests that the relative safety as well as living conditions for NYC residents are improving.
