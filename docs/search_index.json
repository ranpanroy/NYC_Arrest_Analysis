The last column of the second dataset has the same content, but the different name with the last column of the first dataset. So First we rename the last column of the second dataset and then combine the two datasets. The “ARREST_DATE” column is in “char” format and we convert it into “Date” format. Since there are too much data in the dataset, we just focus on the data in the recent 10 years. So We just remain the records whose “ARREST_DATE” is larger than “01/01/2012”.

After calculation, we find there are only 0.7% rows which contain NA values. Therefore, we decide to drop all the rows with NA values.
